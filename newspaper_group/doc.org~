The following section discribes the steps of scraping and cleaning as well as the explorative data analysis.
In this context scraping is the step of automated downloading raw HTML-files from a specific source. Cleaning discribes 
the extraction of selected text elements, i.e. the article itself, the title or date it was published.
Since this project aims to do research not on one specific newspaper
homepage but rather a whole selection, cf. chapter(), the process of scraping homepages and
extracting data or cleaning differs for each site. However the method as such stays the same, thus can
be explained using pseudo-code.
